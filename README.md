### Project Description

Lock-Watcher transforms your Mac into a stealthy security guardian. It monitors various system triggers - wake-up events, login attempts, power changes, USB connections, and wrong password entries - to detect potential unauthorized access. When triggered, it captures high-quality photos along with location, IP address, and network trace-route information, storing everything securely for later review.

## Features

- **Camera Selection** - Choose between built-in or external cameras for surveillance
- **High-Quality Capture** - Optimal photo capture with smart compression
- **Easy Configuration** - Simple setup for triggers and storage locations

### Security Triggers

- **On WakeUp** - Captures when Mac exits sleep mode
- **On Login** - Captures on user login events
- **On Battery Power Switch** - Captures when switching between AC and battery (laptops)
- **On USB Mount** - Captures when USB devices are connected
- **On Wrong Password** - Captures on failed login attempts (Non-MAS only)

### Snapshot Information

Each capture includes:
- Device location (GPS coordinates)
- Network IP address
- Network trace-route analysis
- Timestamp with date formatting

### Storage Options

- **Local Database** - Encrypted storage on your Mac
- **iCloud** - Sync to iCloud Drive
- **Dropbox** - Cloud backup via Dropbox
- **Mail** - Email delivery (Non-MAS only)

### Additional Features

- **Organized Files** - Date-formatted naming for easy retrieval
- **Customizable Menubar** - Icon indicator and notifications on triggers
- **Password Protection** - Secure access to snapshots and settings
- **Biometric Authentication** - Apple Watch and Touch ID keyboard support

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Lock-Watcher
```

### 2. Open in Xcode

```bash
open Lock-Watcher.xcodeproj
```

### 3. Build and Run

Select the appropriate scheme:
- **Lock-Watcher** - Mac App Store build
- **Lock-Watcher-non-mas** - Direct distribution build

Press `Cmd+R` to build and run.

## Building

### MAS (Mac App Store) Build

```bash
xcodebuild -project Lock-Watcher.xcodeproj \
           -scheme Lock-Watcher \
           -configuration Release \
           build
```

### Non-MAS (Direct Distribution) Build

```bash
xcodebuild -project Lock-Watcher.xcodeproj \
           -scheme Lock-Watcher-non-mas \
           -configuration Release \
           build
```

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
xcodebuild test \
    -project Lock-Watcher.xcodeproj \
    -scheme Lock-Watcher \
    -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

### Run UI Tests

```bash
xcodebuild test \
    -project Lock-Watcher.xcodeproj \
    -scheme Lock-Watcher \
    -destination 'platform=macOS' \
    -only-testing:Lock-WatcherUITests
```

## Development

### Code Style

Project uses **SwiftFormat** for consistent code formatting:

```bash
swiftformat .
```

Configuration in `.swiftformat` file.

### Reset App Permissions

For development testing, reset all permissions:

```bash
tccutil reset All com.igrsoft.Lock-Watcher
```

### Build Configurations

| Config | Bundle ID | Features |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| MAS | com.igrsoft.Lock-Watcher | App Store compliant |
| Non-MAS | com.igrsoft.Lock-Watcher-nonmas | Full features (Mail, WrongPassword) |

## Privacy & Security

Lock-Watcher prioritizes your privacy and security:

- **No Third-Party Services**: Data is never sent to external analytics or tracking services
- **Local Storage**: All captures stored locally or in your own cloud accounts
- **Encrypted Storage**: Local database uses encryption
- **Biometric Protection**: Optional Touch ID/Apple Watch authentication
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary system permissions
