    /// This method creates a new `NSWindow`, sets the provided view as its root content, and then displays it.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - title: The title string to be used as the window's title.
    ///   - sender: The object that initiates the opening of the window. This can be used to further customize or control the action based on the sender. Usually passed as `nil` when not needed.
    /// - Returns: An `NSWindow` object representing the created window.
    ///
    /// - Usage:
    /// ```swift
    /// Text("Hello, World!")
    ///     .openInWindow(title: "Greetings", sender: nil)
    /// ```
